Revision history for Perl extension App-perlfind

2.05  2012-09-01 19:39:33 Europe/Vienna
    - fixed App::perlfind::Plugin::Perlvar docs
    - UseModule plugin: don't try to use() it if it doesn't look like a package
      name

2.04  2012-09-01 12:32:15 Europe/Vienna
    - built-in functions can again be found without '-f' (thanks Steven
      Haryanto for the bug report)
    - added heuristic for when the search term contains '::': assume it's a
      module if the final symbol starts with an uppercase character, assume
      it's a fully-qualified function otherwise (thanks RWSTAUNER for the bug
      report)
    - __FILE__, __LINE__ and __PACKAGE__ are found in perlfunc, but __DATA__
      and __END__ are found in perldata
    - __DIE__ and __WARN__ are found in perlvar under '%SIG'
    - can find file test functions like -r, -w, -x etc.
    - searching for predefined variables now works with and without the sigil
      as long as the variable is either a number, the topicalizer or has at
      least two word characters. So 'INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR',
      '$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR', 'RS', '$RS' and '$/' all find the same thing.

2.03  2012-03-04 10:34:21 Europe/Vienna
    - complete rewrite; perlfind now based on Pod::Cpandoc and this
      Pod::Perldoc and inherits all of their features. Especially command-line
      switches work like for perldoc.

2.02  2012-03-03 17:02:54 Europe/Vienna
    - show --help if no search term is given

2.01  2012-03-03 16:17:22 Europe/Vienna
    - renamed to "perlfind" after discussion with perl hackers; added a
      deprecation notice to bin/perlzonji

1.111500  2011-05-30 14:06:18 Europe/Vienna
    - Add UNITCHECK - and also move BEGIN CHECK INIT END to perlmod as docs are
      clearer there (thanks ranguard)
