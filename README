NAME
    App::perlfind - A more knowledgeable perldoc

SYNOPSIS
        # perlfind UNIVERSAL::isa
        # (runs `perldoc perlobj`)

DESCRIPTION
    "perlfind" is like "perldoc" except it knows about more things. Try
    these:

        perlfind xor
        perlfind foreach
        perlfind isa
        perlfind AUTOLOAD
        perlfind TIEARRAY
        perlfind INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR
        perlfind '$^F'
        perlfind '\Q'
        perlfind PERL5OPT
        perlfind :mmap
        perlfind __WARN__
        perlfind __PACKAGE__
        perlfind head4

    For efficiency, "alias pod=perlfind".

FUNCTIONS
  run
    The main function, which is called by the "perlfind" program.

  try_module
    Takes as argument the name of a module, tries to load that module and
    executes the formatter, giving that module as an argument. If loading
    the module fails, this subroutine does nothing.

  execute
    Executes the given command using "exec()". In debug mode, it also prints
    the command before executing it.

  find_matches
    Takes a word and returns the matches for that word. It's in a separate
    function to separate logic from presentation so other programs can use
    this module as well.

OPTIONS
    Options can be shortened according to "Case and abbreviations" in
    Getopt::Long.

    "--perldoc-command", "-c"
        Specifies the POD formatter/pager to delegate to. Default is
        "perldoc" "annopod" from AnnoCPAN::Perldoc is a better alternative.

    "--debug"
        Prints the whole command before executing it.

    "--dry-run", "-n"
        Just print the command that would be executed; don't actually
        execute it.

    "--help", "-h", "-?"
        Prints a brief help message and exits.

    "--man", "-m"
        Prints the manual page and exits.
