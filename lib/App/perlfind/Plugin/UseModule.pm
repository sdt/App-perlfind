=head1 NAME

App::perlfind::Plugin::UseModule - Try the search word as a module name

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # perlfind Getopt::Long

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin for L<App::perlfind> tries to use the search term as a module name.
If the module can be loaded, it is added to the match results.

If it contains '::', it might be a fully qualified function name such as
C<Foo::Bar::some_function> or a module that's not installed but whose
namespace-parent might be installed. For example, if C<Foo::Bar> is installed
but C<Foo::Bar::Baz> isn't, we don't want think that there is a function
C<Baz()> in the package C<Foo::Bar>; rather we want to show the docs for
C<Foo::Bar::Baz>. To distinguish between a function and a module, use a simple
heuristic, which means it's a guess and won't always work: if the final symbol
starts with an uppercase character, we assume it's a package, otherwise we
assume it's a function.
